# Thoughts should be on the paper
So I decided to write in english to practice composing my thoughts into sentences. Also I feel the need of protocoling stuff I do rarely. Registering domain names, running nginx and even openresty to use lua + nginx, serving different apps on different ports and proxy all these stuff via nginx and subdomain names, creating `systemd` services and preserve nodejs app running forever via `pm2`. Actually I did a lot of this stuff for the first time. Later, when I came back to work on `besokind`, to the server and its structure I felt distracted. Because I couldn't remember how everything structured, how to add new server etc.

Well, here we go.

# My messy server in terms of nginx config

My websocket server for [hnefatafl](https://github.com/drzhbe/hnefatafl) is hosted at `hnef.besokind.ru` on a digitalocean droplet and is served via nginx. There are bunch of servers running on this single $10 droplet for now: `besokind.ru`, vk bot `bmo` written in python.
```
upstream app_besokind {
	server 127.0.0.1:3000;
	keepalive 8;
}

upstream app_bmo {
	server 127.0.0.1:5000;
	keepalive 8;
}

upstream hnef_server {
	server 127.0.0.1:3030;
	keepalive 8;
}

server {
	listen 443 ssl;
	server_name besokind.ru;
	access_log /var/log/openresty/access_besokind.log;
	error_log /var/log/openresty/error_besokind.log;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://app_besokind/;
	}

	location /onpush {
		content_by_lua_file /home/besokind/besokind-droplet/onpush.lua;
	}

	ssl on;
	ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/besokind.ru/cert.pem;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/besokind.ru/privkey.pem;
	proxy_set_header    Host              $host;
	proxy_set_header    X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
	proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-SSL on;
	proxy_set_header    X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
	proxy_redirect off;
}

server {
	listen 80 default_server;
	listen [::]:80 default_server;
	server_name besokind.ru;
	return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
}

server {
	listen 80;
	server_name bmo.besokind.ru;
	access_log /var/log/nginx/bmo.log;

	location / {
		proxy_pass http://app_bmo/;
	}
}

server {
	listen 80;
	server_name hnef.besokind.ru;

	access_log /var/log/openresty/access_hnef.log;
	error_log /var/log/openresty/error_hnef.log;

	location / {
		proxy_http_version 1.1;
		proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
		proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://hnef_server;
	}
}
```


# How to create a systemd service

bmo is running through `systemd` service. To create a systemd service I just created a text file `bmo.service`
```
[Unit]
Description=Python VK bot
After=network.target

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/home/besokind/bmo/
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /home/besokind/bmo/app.py
Restart=on-failure
KillMode=process

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Alias=bmo.service
```
and symlinked it into `/etc/systemd/system`
```
ln -s /home/besokind/bmo/bmo.service /etc/systemd/system/bmo.service
```


I have some aliases for bmo in my ~/.bashrc on the droplet
```
alias bmo='cd /home/besokind/bmo'
alias bmo-restart='systemctl restart bmo'
alias bmo-status='systemctl status bmo'
```

# How to register a domain name

Today I registered `tafl.website` domain name on namecheap.com.

## Namecheap

![domain tab](https://i.imgur.com/mg9I8rY.png)
On namecheap → dashboard → domain list → domain I set `custom DNS` nameservers for digitalocean:
```
ns1.digitalocean.com
ns2.digitalocean.com
ns3.digitalocean.com
```
![list of nameservers](https://i.imgur.com/VHnEjEl.png)


## Digitalocean

![networking tab](https://i.imgur.com/XP5XWEf.png)
On digitalocean → networking add a domain and create 2 records for it:
- A record @
- CNAME for www is an alias of tafl.website

# How to serve via HTTPS
To serve via HTTPS you need 2 thins:
1. Signed SSL Certificate
2. Listen to 443 port instead of 80, enable ssl and attach the certificate

## Obtain the Certificate

I use a certificate signed by [lets encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). I created it via [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).

But before running the certbot I prepared nginx conf to serve static by my new domain name:
```
server {
	listen 80;
	server_name tafl.website;
	root /home/besokind/hnefatafl;
}
```
And restarted the server.

Then run `certbot`:
```
certbot certonly
```
I already prepared my server so I authenticate ACME CA by
```
2. Placing files in webroot directory
```
It places a file into the webdir (/home/besokind/hnefatafl) /.well-known/acme-challenge/123abc and requests it from letsencrypt's servers.
Then entered my new domain name `tafl.website`, web directory for it `/home/besokind/hnefatafl` and here we go.
My new certificate is located at `/etc/letsencrypt/live/tafl.website`. Now I use `cert.pem` and `privkey.pem` in my server:
```
server {
	listen 443 ssl;
	server_name tafl.website;
	root /home/besokind/hnefatafl/public;

	ssl on;
	ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/tafl.website/cert.pem;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/tafl.website/privkey.pem;

	access_log /var/log/openresty/access_hnef.log;
	error_log /var/log/openresty/error_hnef.log;
}
```

That's it. After 3 months I'll came to the droplet and will make:
```
certbot renew
```
You could also make a cronjob, but I'm okay with manual renewal for now.


# How to proxy websocket?

In nginx we need headers Upgrade and Connection. They are available from http version 1.1, so set the version too:
```
location /server/ {
	proxy_http_version 1.1;
	proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
	proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;

    proxy_pass http://hnef_server;
}
```
To be able to serve client index.html at `tafl.website` without any path additions I serve socket.io at path `/server`.
To do that we add `{path: '/server/socket.io'}` option after url.
On the server
```javascript
io.listen(3030, {path: '/server/socket.io'});
```
and on the client
```javascript
var socket = require('socket.io-client')(url, {path: '/server/socket.io'});
```
